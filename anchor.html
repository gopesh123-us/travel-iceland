      Google is one of the world’s leading technology companies, best known for its search engine that has become a gateway to the internet for billions of people. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google has grown far beyond search, expanding into products like Gmail, Google Maps,
      YouTube, Chrome, and the Android operating system. The company is also a pioneer in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital advertising, which form the backbone of its revenue. With its mission to "organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,"
      Google continues to shape the way people interact with technology, while also investing in future-forward innovations such as self-driving cars, smart devices, and quantum computing.

    <p id="facebook">
      Facebook, founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and his college peers, is one of the most influential social networking platforms in the world. Originally created to connect students at Harvard University, it quickly expanded to a global audience and now serves billions of users. Facebook allows
      people to share updates, photos, videos, and connect with friends, family, and communities across the globe. Over time, the platform has evolved into a hub for businesses, advertising, and digital engagement, while also acquiring other major platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. Now operating
      under its parent company, Meta, Facebook plays a central role in shaping online social interaction and is expanding its vision toward the metaverse, aiming to build immersive digital experiences for the future.

      An image is a visual representation of an object, scene, or idea, captured or created through various means such as photography, drawing, painting, or digital design. Images play a powerful role in communication, as they can often convey emotions, information, and concepts more quickly and
      effectively than words. In today’s digital world, images are everywhere—on social media, websites, advertisements, and educational materials—helping to grab attention and enhance understanding. They can be realistic, abstract, or symbolic, and are often used to document memories, express
      creativity, or illustrate ideas. Whether static or moving, images remain one of the most universal and impactful forms of expression.
