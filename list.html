      <dd>
        Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, is one of the most influential and controversial political figures in the country's history. Rising from humble beginnings, Modi's journey to the top began in the state of Gujarat, where he served as Chief Minister before becoming Prime Minister in
        2014. Known for his charismatic leadership and strong communication skills, Modi has implemented ambitious economic reforms, such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the demonetization of high-value currency notes in 2016. His tenure has been marked by a focus on infrastructure
        development, digitalization, and a push for "Make in India" to boost manufacturing. However, his leadership has also faced criticism, particularly over issues like religious polarization and the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the debates surrounding his policies, Modi's
        popularity remains high, with his nationalist rhetoric and vision of a stronger, self-reliant India resonating with millions.
